# JsPlsyer Android project

This is a minimal Android Studio project skeleton for *JsPlsyer*.
It loads the URL `https://playvideos.page.gd` in a fullscreen WebView with media autoplay enabled.

**Notes:**
- You need Android Studio or a CI service (Codemagic, App Center) to build the APK.
- This project intentionally keeps autostart and kiosk features disabled as requested.

URL: https://playvideos.page.gd

## How to build
1. Open this folder in Android Studio and let it download Gradle/SDK.
2. Build > Generate Signed Bundle / APK.

## Help
If you want, I can produce a GitHub Actions/Codemagic YAML to build automatically.
